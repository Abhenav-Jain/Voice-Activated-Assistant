## 🚀 About the Project

"Jarvis" is a Python-based Voice-Activated Personal Assistant designed to simplify everyday tasks through simple text/voice commands.  
This assistant can open websites, search Google, play music, tell the current date and time, and even crack a joke — all while interacting with you using Text-to-Speech (TTS)!

This is one of my first AI-driven projects and a step toward building smarter assistants in the future!
